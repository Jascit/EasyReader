# EasyReader

My very first project that's supposed to deepen my understanding of programming generally and building projects


#


# What is EasyReader?

EasyReader is a app that is supposed to:
<ul>
<li>Let you read Mangas like on <a href="https://github.com/mihonapp/mihon">Mihon</a></li>
<li>Let you read Web Novels</li>
<li>Let you insert pdf files </li> 
</ul>

The app is intended to be developed for both iOS and Android in order to reach the widest possible target audience
