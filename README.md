# EasyReader

My very first project that's supposed to deepen my understanding of programming and project development



# What is EasyReader?

EasyReader is an app that is supposed to:
<ul>
<li>Let you read manga, similar to <a href="https://github.com/mihonapp/mihon">Mihon</a></li>
<li>Let you read web novels</li>
<li>Let you import PDF files </li> 
</ul>

The app is intended to be released for Android  (and maybe iOS ????) devices
